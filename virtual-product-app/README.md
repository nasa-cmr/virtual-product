# virtual-product-app

The Virtual Product Application adds the concept of Virtual Products to the CMR. Virtual Products represent products at a data provider that are generated on demand from users when they are ordered or downloaded through a URL. A data provider will create a virtual product collection in the CMR. Then within the Virtual Product App the virtual product will be configured with a source collection. Whenever any granule is ingested in the source collection an equivalent ingest will be sent for each of the virtual products that are configured with that source collection.
